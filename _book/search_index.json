Federal public land management agencies in the United States offer a variety of outdoor recreation activities to visitors. However, people from different socioeconomic and identity groups access federal public lands unequally due to historical discrimination and current inequities. This project uses data from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) and the United States Census Bureau (US Census) to explore patterns of visitor use of reservable overnight sites (such as campgrounds, cabins, hike-in, and more). Specifically, we used 2018 reservation data and US Census data from the next available year to 2018 (i.e. 2018 median income data, 2015 language data). We created the interactive Outdoor Equity App that gives users tools to summarize data, explore relationships between RIDB and US Census variables, view maps of where visitors are coming from for reservable sites in California, and download subset data. This technical documentation includes information on metadata, application maintenance, and next steps for expanding the app to include visitor data from more locations and time periods. 1.2 About the Authors This technical documentation for the Outdoor Equity App was created by Clarissa Boyajian and Halina Do-Linh. The app was created as the final capstone project for their Master of Environmental Data Science degrees from the University of California’s Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management. Both women are passionate about environmental justice, open science, the art of data visualizations, and spending time recreating outdoors. Please reach out to either of both of us with any questions. This project could not have been completed without the support and guidance of the Bren School advisors Dr. Frank Davis and Dr. Allison Horst and our external advisors Dr. Kaitlyn Gaynor and Dr. Will Rice. 1.3 Helpful Links and Resources The Outdoor Equity App is was created with the shiny package (Chang et al. 2021) using RStudio version 1.4.1717-3.

Federal public land management agencies in the United States offer a wide variety of activities to visitors. However, people from different socioeconomic and identity groups access federal public lands unequally due to historical discrimination and current inequities. The multi-agency program, Recreation One Stop (R1S), oversees the operations of Recreation.gov and aims to increase access to recreation by providing online resources about nationwide recreational opportunities, allowing visitors to make reservations, and making the associated data accessible to all. The rich data on visitors that R1S collects presents an opportunity for the creation of more robust data-driven analytical tools to understand the patterns and correlations of this unequal access across the country and within individual recreation areas. Decision-makers can use these tools to explore and visualize how recreational opportunities on federal public lands are accessed. Our overarching objective is to design and built an interactive web application that allows users to analyze patterns in the access and demand of visitors at reservable overnight sites (such as campgrounds, cabins, hike-in, and more), using data from the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) and the United States Census Bureau (US Census). These analyses will allow federal public land managers to explore relationships among attributes of recreation opportunities, reservation practices, and socioeconomic data from the regions of visitor origin. We achieved this goal through the creation of an interactive web application, the Outdoor Equity App, that allows for a wide range of visualization, metadata documentation, and subset data downloads. This technical documentation serves to document the Outdoor Equity App creation process, include information for ongoing maintenance, and provide suggestions for future use and expansion. The app - which is implemented using the R programming language - accesses public RIDB and US Census data via direct download and application programming interfaces (API). All data and R code scripts are stored on the UCSB Taylor Server and version-controlled through GitHub. We isolated necessary variables and defined, standardized, and aggregated values in the data cleaning process. We calculated additional derived variables for each reservation, such as distance traveled and booking window, and summary statistics (e.g., mean and median) for census data at the ZIP code level. A data set that combines the US Census and RIDB data based on visitors’ home ZIP code is the foundation for the Outdoor Equity App. We visualized distributions of variables and relationships between them with simple, straightforward figures. Within the app, users can subset the data to a specific overnight reservable site and visualize the distribution of a single variable, the relationship between two variables, or the visitorshed map (i.e. area from where visitors are coming) for the selected site. The app currently only includes data for California reservable sites in fiscal year 2018 due to project scope limitations. Throughout the analysis and app creation processes, external advisors and federal public land managers have reviewed and tested the Outdoor Equity App. We incorporated feedback into all parts of the processes to ensure our data, analysis, and final products are robust. Potential future updates to the Outdoor Equity App are discussed in this technical documentation and include temporal and spatial expansions and app maintenance. The temporal expansion would include cleaning additional datasets for years from 2012 to 2021 as well as expanding the app’s interface to allow for temporal selections when subsetting data. The spatial expansion would focus on updating the app structure and server hosting capabilities so the app runs smoothly with data from the full United States. As environmental justice is increasingly recognized as a necessary lens to achieve environmental goals, equitable access to outdoor recreation is a high priority for managers. This tool assists managers to be equity-conscious decision-makers, can be a springboard for researchers who have questions about outdoor recreation, and strengthens nonprofit organizations’ advocacy efforts. We also hope it will be a dynamic tool that empowers visitors to access the information and resources they need to explore outdoor recreation. "],["problem-statement.html", "Section 3 Problem Statement 3.1 Background 3.2 Significance 3.3 Figures", " Section 3 Problem Statement 3.1 Background Outdoor recreation provides critical health and well-being benefits to communities, and in the United States, federal public lands play an important role in providing access to nature. However, access is not equal for all people (Ewert and Hollenhorst 1990); (Flores et al. 2018), which has been recognized as an environmental injustice (Floyd and Johnson 2002). Many studies have shown that federally managed public land is accessed unequally due to historical discrimination and current inequities (Floyd and Johnson 2002); (Shelby, Whittaker, and Danley 1989); (Xiao, Lee, and Larson 2021). Many land management agencies in the U.S. are tasked with the dual mandate of providing recreational opportunities for visitors while also preserving and conserving natural resources and places (Shartaj and Suter 2020). For over a century, striking the balance necessary to uphold this mandate has proven a challenge for federal agencies like the National Parks Service (Meinecke 1937); (Sax 1980), and the recent growth of recreation (Figure 3.1) has renewed concerns about its potential negative environmental impacts and changes to the visitor experience (Hammitt, Cole, and Monz 2015); (Timmons 2019). The challenge now facing public land management agencies is how to allocate quality visitor experiences to a more diverse user base. Simply increasing recreation opportunities on public land is not a viable solution to this rising demand. While managers seek to allocate existing resources (e.g. campsites) through the fairest means possible, including reservation systems, equal opportunities do not translate to equitable access (Shelby, Whittaker, and Danley 1989). Historically, policies of segregation barred certain racial groups from using federal public lands and the legacy of these policies has perpetuated inequitable access for certain racial groups to this day (Xiao, Lee, and Larson 2021). Additionally, previous and current inequities like lack of time, disposable income, access to technology, and lack of social or institutional knowledge about reservation systems impact access to federal public lands (Scott and Lee 2018). At present, park visitation and camping are seeing a surge in popularity, heightened even more by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this rapid increase in demand for recreation opportunities may only further these inequities. 3.2 Significance Currently, much of our understanding about trends in recreation on public lands comes from the Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) Portal, which the National Parks Service uses to monitor visitor counts over time (Bergstrom, Stowers, and Shonkwiler 2020). However, these data lack information on where visitors are coming from. This project leverages the Recreation Information Database (RIDB), managed by Recreation One Stop, an inter-agency partnership that provides reservation services and trip-planning tools on Recreation.gov. The RIDB is far more robust, including data from other land management agencies, and information on visitor zip codes, costs, group sizes, and dates of both reservations and recreation activities. While it is available for public download, there are few robust data-driven analytical tools to understand the patterns and relationships of these inequities within individual recreation areas. Previous research has demonstrated the value of RIDB data in forecasting future recreation demand for single park units (Rice et al. 2019) and analyzing preferential characteristics for popular recreational facilities (Rice and Park 2021). A recent study summarizing RIDB data from national parks (Walls, Wichman, and Ankney 2018) also identified broad patterns in reservations. For example, campsite reservations are made far in advance, but many are canceled last minute (Figure 3.2); visitors tend to visit national parks near their homes (Figure 3.3); and the distribution of incomes of campers appears to be similar to the U.S. population as a whole (Figure 3.4). However, overall, the vast RIDB data has received limited system-level research attention to date, and this work will be the first to explore issues of equity with RIDB data. Furthermore, much of the existing research on outdoor recreation focuses on National Park Service lands, such as Walls, Wichman, and Ankney (2018), which is only a small percentage of all federal land used by the public. The other land management agencies, including US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Army Corps of Engineers, often lack the capacity and funding to process reservation data, and are less frequently the subjects of outside research. Little is known about how patterns of access and demand vary across land management types. The RIDB includes data from all federal land management agencies, and therefore has tremendous promise to inform our understanding of patterns and trends in recreation across space and time and to inform policies for more equitable campground access for all federal public lands. Our overarching objective for this project is to utilize data from RIDB and US Census to analyze spatial and demand patterns of visitor access at reservable overnight sites (such as campgrounds, cabins, hike-in, and more). We chose to focus on reservable sites since recent studies have shown this type of outdoor recreation to be a good proxy for visitation to federal public lands (Walls, Wichman, and Ankney 2018). These analyses will provide federal public managers an opportunity to explore relationships between and within socioeconomic and reservation variables. 3.3 Figures Figure 3.1: Total annual visitors to the National Park Service system, since its inception through 2020. Visitation has been rapidly increasing, particularly within the last decade. (Source: IRMA) Figure 3.2: Reproduced from Walls, Wichman, and Ankney (2018).

This project addressed this need by creating the Outdoor Equity App, an interactive platform for summarizing and visualizing site-specific patterns and trends in visitation volume, demand, and visitors’ location of origin. The platform will integrate nationwide Recreation.gov reservation data with US census data to: Gain insights into demand for reservations across different types of recreation areas. Analyze access to federal public lands among historically underserved groups in relation to recreation site type, cost, location, and demand.

We accessed, cleaned, and wrangled all data outside of the Outdoor Equity App using the data_wrangle_and_clean.Rmd document and 18 custom-made functions (Tables 5.2). We downloaded RIDB data in CSV format from Recreation.gov and ACS data through API using the R package tidycensus (Walker and Herman 2021). We first subsetted RIDB and ACS datasets to include only the variables relevant to our objectives. We then normalized, aggregated, and calculated variables as necessary. Once both datasets are cleaned and wrangled, we joined them using ZIP codes as the key (common value in both datasets). Finally we wrangled the joined RIDB and ACS dataset to ready them for creating data relationship plots.

Users of this app can select a single reservable site to create custom plots that show a data summary of a single variable or a data relationship between two variables. Visualizations of multiple reservable sites appear as separate plots. Users can also select a single site to create a visitorshed map for the full United States and for the state in which the site is located. 5.4 Outdoor Equity App The app has a navigation bar with four tabs: About, Analysis, Metadata and Data Download. Nested under the Analysis tab are the subtabs of Data Summary, Data Relationship, and Visitorshed Maps. The app opens automatically to the About tab.

We consulted other researchers who are familiar with the RIDB datasets to confirm outliers or other anomalies in the data. Additionally, we documented the percent loss from data wrangling to ensure that our cleaning and wrangling of the data were reasonable. 7.2 Code Review We conducted code reviews within the team, and with faculty or external advisers. We reviewed specific code chunks and scripts related to the Outdoor Equity App. We separated our workflows so that one person created scripts, and the other reviewed them. We did this to maintain some objectivity when evaluating if our datasets were aggregating correctly. We also had a separate workflow for metadata, where one person created and wrote metadata, and the other reviewed it. This confirmed that the data matches how it is being described in the metadata. This confirmation is important as we want our client to be able to scale our product and workflows for future use. 7.3 Product Testing We used three packages to test our R Shiny app. We used shinytest (Chang, Csárdi, and Wickham 2021) to ensure our app is visualized the way we expect it to using the package’s snapshot-based testing strategy. We used shinyloadtest (Schloerke, Dipert, and Borges 2021) to test the server hosting the R Shiny App to ensure that it responds in a reasonable amount of time based on the inputs a user provides. Similarly, we utilized the tictoc (Izrailev 2021) package during our data wrangling and cleaning, and when we initially created our plots, graphs, and maps to estimate an informed guess of how long it may take the app to run our scripts. Lastly, we used the reactlog (Schloerke 2020) package’s diagnostic tool which creates a reactive visualizer for the app to make sure that reactive elements are working the way we expected them to. It is important to note that this diagnostic tool was not useful as our app functionality increased, as the reactive visualizer became impossible to read. There may be other options within reactlog to use the reactive visualizer in a different way, but we did not have enough time to research this. We added temporary print statements to all functions in the app to ensure that the functions were working correctly were are outputting what we expect. We removed print statements from functions that were functioning with zero errors. We did this because print statements can take a long time to run and should not be left in functions or in the app permanently. Additionally, we held multiple meetings with the Recreation One Stop team to obtain real-time and focused feedback to improve user design and experience. 7.3.1 Next steps for testing Due to time constraints, we were not able to implement all testing methods we wanted. We recommend the following testing strategies to make the app more robust and for smoother functionality. Use the R package testthat (Wickham 2022) to conduct unit tests on the scripts used to create Tidy datasets and for subsetted datasets for visualization. This type of testing may be important to avoid silent failures and to ensure that the datasets are aggregating correctly. Use gremlin.js), a JavaScript library used for “Monkey testing” to test the behavior of the R Shiny App. This package is compatible with shiny (Chang et al. 2021) and does not require any external installation. See Chapter 11 in Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps for more guidance. “Monkey testing” is a type of testing where random, automated tests provide random inputs and then checks the behavior of the app (i.e. if the system or application crashes). We were able to find some finicky bugs through our own testing of random inputs, but “Monkey testing” is the formal process of testing app behavior. Employ user testing with federal public land managers, researchers, and those who are not familiar with RIDB data to further enhance the user experience and design.

The intended audience is federal public land managers and researchers as well as nonprofit organizations and recreation users. The Recreation Information Database (RIDB) data are comprehensive when it comes to information regarding the site and reservation, but do not include information about the visitor outside of their home ZIP code. US Census American Community Survey (ACS) data is used to approximate socioeconomic demographics by joining information about the visitors’ home ZIP code to the RIDB data. 8.2 How to Use the Outdoor Equity App 8.2.1 About the App The About tab of the Outdoor Equity App includes background information about what the App is, why outdoor recreation is important, the App creators, and what data is used in the App. These sections are similar to the About Section of this technical documentation. The About tab also includes example questions that a user might explore through the different parts of the Analysis tab. The Analysis tab of the App consists of three parts Data Summary, Data Relationship and Visitorshed Maps. Each of these pages includes a brief explanatory section of how to interpret the plot or graph, a section to subset the data to the desired campsite, and the plot or map outputs. The Metadata tab of the App includes metadata for all variables in the combined RIDB and ACS dataset. This section mirrors the Metadata section in the Products and Deliverables Section of this document. The Data Download section of the App allows a user to download a subset of data include as many or as few campsites and variables as they require for further analysis or use. 8.3 How to Maintain the Outdoor Equity App 8.3.1 Data Preparation Methods 8.3.1.1 RIDB Data RIDB data data are available through direct download as CSV files or via the API as JSON files via Recreation.gov. API access requires creating a Recreation.gov account and requesting second tier API access via the Recreation.gov website’s Contact Us page. CSV files are readily available for download via the Recreation.gov website. Data are collected each time a visitor makes a reservation through Recreation.gov. Data packages are posted annually in the spring by R1S and contain the previous fiscal year’s reservations (ex: the 2018 package includes 2018-10-01 through 2018-09-30). Data packages are available for download from 2006 to present. Each annual data package file contains a range between 2 million and 5 million observations (or reservations) and includes variables in character, numeric, and date/time formats about each reservation. A shift in the data collection and storage processes occurred in 2019, changing what variables are available and how they are labeled. Currently, the Outdoor Equity App contains only data for reservable sites in California and reservations for fiscal year 2018. A reproducible workflow for cleaning and wrangling data is employed in the data_wrangle_and_clean.Rmd document that sources custom functions to prepare RIDB data for joining with ACS data. All custom functions locations within the repository are listed in the Access, Clean, and Wrangle Data Section of this document. These functions rely heavily on functions from the tidyverse collection of packages (Wickham 2021). First, a the function_ridb_subset-pre2018.R is used to subset the RIDB data, filtering only reservations within the selected state that are listed as “Overnight” reservations within the use_type variable. For the 2018 California dataset this results in a starting “raw” data frame with 521,682 reservations # filter for state filter(facility_state == state_abbrev) %&gt;% # filter for use type filter(use_type == &quot;Overnight&quot;) The function then selects only the necessary variables, including information about the site (agency, park or forest name, site name, site type, and site location) and information about the reservation (home ZIP come, total paid, visit start and end dates, visit order date, and number of people in party). # select variables select(c(&quot;agency&quot;, &quot;parent_location&quot;, &quot;region_description&quot;, &quot;park&quot;, &quot;site_type&quot;, &quot;facility_id&quot;, &quot;facility_state&quot;, &quot;facility_longitude&quot;, &quot;facility_latitude&quot;, &quot;customer_zip&quot;, &quot;total_paid&quot;, &quot;start_date&quot;, &quot;end_date&quot;, &quot;order_date&quot;, &quot;number_of_people&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(site_type = tolower(site_type)) %&gt;% filter(!site_type %in% c(&quot;historic tour&quot;, &quot;hiking zone&quot;, &quot;group picnic area&quot;, &quot;cave tour&quot;, &quot;management&quot;, &quot;picnic&quot;, &quot;entry point&quot;, &quot;trailhead&quot;)) The customer ZIP code values are then normalized. This includes filtering for only US ZIP codes and shortening all 9 digit ZIP codes to include only the first 5 digits. # filter out invalid ZIP codes filter(str_detect(string = customer_zip, pattern = &quot;^[:digit:]{5}(?!.)&quot;) | str_detect(string = customer_zip, pattern = &quot;^[:digit:]{5}(?=-)&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(!customer_zip %in% c(&quot;00000&quot;, &quot;99999&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(customer_zip = str_extract(string = customer_zip, pattern = &quot;[:digit:]{5}&quot;)) This function results in the removal of 24,866 reservations (or 4.77%) from the original “raw” dataset that included all reservations for reservable overnight campsites in California. A second custom function is then utilized to calculate and manipulate variables of interest. Start, end, and order dates calculate the lengths of stay and booking windows (number of days from order to start date) of each reservation. The booking window calculations return a number of results that are negative. This is a known issue that others working with the RIDB data have encountered. This resulted in 4,530 reservations (or 0.87%) without a valid booking window. mutate(start_date = as.Date(start_date), end_date = as.Date(end_date), order_date = as.Date(order_date), # calculate new variables length_of_stay = as.numeric(difftime(end_date, start_date), units = &quot;days&quot;), booking_window = as.numeric(difftime(start_date, order_date), units = &quot;days&quot;)) Total costs are divided by lengths of stay to calculate cost per day and cost per day per visitor. # calculate new variables mutate(daily_cost = total_paid / length_of_stay, daily_cost_per_visitor = daily_cost / number_of_people) Site types are aggregated to create 7 broader site categories. # aggregate site type mutate(aggregated_site_type = case_when(site_type %in% c(&quot;walk to&quot;, &quot;hike to&quot;, &quot;group hike to&quot;, &quot;group walk to&quot; ) ~ &quot;remote&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;cabin nonelectric&quot;, &quot;cabin electric&quot;, &quot;yurt&quot;,&quot;shelter nonelectric&quot; ) ~ &quot;shelter&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;boat in&quot;, &quot;anchorage&quot;) ~ &quot;water&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;group equestrian&quot;, &quot;equestrian nonelectric&quot;) ~ &quot;equestrian&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;rv nonelectric&quot;, &quot;rv electric&quot;, &quot;group rv area nonelectric&quot; ) ~ &quot;rv only&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;group standard nonelectric&quot;, &quot;standard nonelectric&quot;, &quot;standard electric&quot;, &quot;group standard area nonelectric&quot;, &quot;group standard electric&quot; ) ~ &quot;rv or tent&quot;, site_type %in% c(&quot;tent only nonelectric&quot;, &quot;group tent only area nonelectric&quot;, &quot;tent only electric&quot; ) ~ &quot;tent only&quot;)) The administrative unit variable is created by combining the parent_location and region_description variables as different federal agencies track the administrative unit information in different variables. Then the agency, admin_uni and park variables character strings are updated using multiple functions from the stringr package (Wickham 2019). mutate(admin_unit = case_when(agency == &quot;USFS&quot; ~ parent_location, agency %in% c(&quot;NPS&quot;, &quot;BOR&quot;, &quot;USACE&quot;) ~ region_description)) %&gt;% # edit values mutate( # agency abbreviations to names agency = str_replace(string = agency, pattern = &quot;NPS&quot;, replacement = &quot;National Park Service&quot;), agency = str_replace(string = agency, pattern = &quot;USFS&quot;, replacement = &quot;US Forest Service&quot;), agency = str_replace(string = agency, pattern = &quot;USACE&quot;, replacement = &quot;US Army Corps of Engineers&quot;), agency = str_replace(string = agency, pattern = &quot;BOR&quot;, replacement = &quot;Bureau of Reclamation&quot;), # update admin_unit values (generic) admin_unit = str_replace(string = admin_unit, pattern = paste(c(&quot;NF - FS&quot;, &quot;NF -FS&quot;, &quot;NF- FS&quot;, &quot;NF-FS&quot;, &quot;-FS&quot;, &quot; - FS&quot;), collapse = &quot;|&quot;), replacement = &quot;National Forest&quot;), admin_unit = str_to_title(admin_unit), admin_unit = str_replace(string = admin_unit, pattern = &quot;And&quot;, replacement = &quot;&amp;&quot;), # update park values (generic) park = str_remove(string = park, pattern = paste(c(&quot;\\\\(.*&quot;, &quot; \\\\(.*&quot;, &quot;---.*&quot;, &quot; ---.*&quot;, &quot;,.*&quot;), collapse = &quot;|&quot;)), park = str_to_title(park), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = &quot;Cg&quot;, replacement = &quot;Campground&quot;), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = &quot;Nhp&quot;, replacement = &quot;National Historic Park&quot;), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = &quot;@&quot;, replacement = &quot;At&quot;), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = &quot;&amp;&quot;, replacement = &quot;And&quot;), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = paste(c(&quot;/&quot;, &quot; / &quot;), collapse = &quot;|&quot;), replacement = &quot; &quot;), park = str_remove_all(string = park, pattern = &quot; \\\\d.*&quot;), # update park values (CA specific) park = str_remove(string = park, pattern = paste(c(&quot; - Angeles Nf&quot;, &quot; -Hwy&quot;), collapse = &quot;|&quot;)), park = str_replace(string = park, pattern = &quot;Tunnel Mills Il&quot;, replacement = &quot;Tunnel Mills&quot;), admin_unit = str_replace(string = admin_unit, pattern = &quot;Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Park$&quot;, replacement = &quot;Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks&quot;)) Distance traveled is calculated by measuring the distance from the latitude and longitude facility coordinate locations to the centroid of the home ZIP code, which is accessed via the tidycensus package (Walker and Herman 2021). # bootstrap geometries and reproject to NAD 83 df_geometries &lt;- df %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords = c(&quot;facility_longitude&quot;, &quot;facility_latitude&quot;), crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(crs = 4269) # using NAD83 because measured in meters # get centroid of geometries for all US ZIP codes df_zip_centroids_us &lt;- get_acs(geography = &quot;zcta&quot;, year = 2018, geometry = TRUE, summary_var = &quot;B01001_001&quot;, survey = &quot;acs5&quot;, variables = c(male = &quot;B01001_002&quot;)) %&gt;% select(NAME, geometry) %&gt;% mutate(zip_code = str_sub(NAME, start = -5, end = -1)) %&gt;% select(zip_code, geometry) %&gt;% st_centroid() # join data and calculate `distance_traveled` variable df_joined_geometries &lt;- left_join(x = df_geometries %&gt;% as.data.frame(), y = df_zip_centroids_us %&gt;% as.data.frame(), by = c(&quot;customer_zip&quot; = &quot;zip_code&quot;)) %&gt;% st_sf(sf_column_name = &#39;geometry.x&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(distance_traveled_m = st_distance(x = geometry.x, y = geometry.y, by_element = TRUE), distance_traveled_m = as.numeric(distance_traveled_m)) And finally, a variable is added indicating in which state or territory each customer zip code is located.

Our product utilizes the R package tidycensus (Walker and Herman 2021) to access the necessary variables from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) via API. API access requires an api key, which can be . # API set up # ONLY HAVE TO RUN THE FIRST TIME USING THIS RMD on a new machine census_api &lt;- source(&quot;private/census-api.R&quot;) census_api_key(key = census_api[[1]], install = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE) # run in console: readRenviron(&quot;~/.Renviron&quot;) # look at option variables #View(load_variables(2018, &quot;acs5&quot;, cache = TRUE)) Sample data are collected for the ACS each year and includes many variables that cover social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics. The Outdoor Equity App utilizes the ACS 5-year data, which is an estimate representing data collected over the designated 5 year period. We used the 5-year ACS data over the 1-year ACS data because it increases “statistical reliability of the data for less populated areas and small population subgroups” (Bureau 2022). The variables included in the App include median-income, race, language(s) spoken at home, and highest level of education attained. All variables are represented as estimates in numeric format for a ZIP code tabulation area. Data are called by geographic region, in our case the ZIP code tabulation area, and include an estimated number of people that fall into each category within each ZIP code, a margin of error, and an estimated number of total people in the area. Within our custom functions function_acs_education.R, function_acs_language.R, function_acs_median_income.R, and function_acs_race.R we first imported just the necessary columns for each ACS variable. # import variables for race acs_df &lt;- get_acs(geography = &quot;zcta&quot;, year = 2018, state = &quot;CA&quot;, survey = &quot;acs5&quot;, summary_var = &quot;B03002_001&quot;, #Estimate!!Total: variables = c( white = &quot;B03002_003&quot;, #Estimate!!Total!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!White alone black = &quot;B03002_004&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Black or African American alone native_american = &quot;B03002_005&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!American Indian and Alaska Native alone asian = &quot;B03002_006&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Asian alone pacific_islander = &quot;B03002_007&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone other = &quot;B03002_008&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Some other race alone multiracial = &quot;B03002_009&quot;, # Estimate!!Total:!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Two or more races hispanic_latinx = &quot;B03002_012&quot; # Estimate!!Total!!Hispanic or Latino )) ## Getting data from the 2014-2018 5-year ACS head(acs_df, 10) ## # A tibble: 10 × 7 ## GEOID NAME variable estimate moe summary_est summary_moe ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 90001 ZCTA5 90001 white 413 165 58975 1725 ## 2 90001 ZCTA5 90001 black 5138 646 58975 1725 ## 3 90001 ZCTA5 90001 native_american 37 42 58975 1725 ## 4 90001 ZCTA5 90001 asian 67 38 58975 1725 ## 5 90001 ZCTA5 90001 pacific_islander 0 29 58975 1725 ## 6 90001 ZCTA5 90001 other 168 169 58975 1725 ## 7 90001 ZCTA5 90001 multiracial 66 44 58975 1725 ## 8 90001 ZCTA5 90001 hispanic_latinx 53086 1591 58975 1725 ## 9 90002 ZCTA5 90002 white 223 81 53111 2031 ## 10 90002 ZCTA5 90002 black 10110 876 53111 2031 Percentages for the categories within each ACS variable are calculated for race, language(s) spoken in the home, and highest level of education by dividing the estimate for a category by the estimated total population for that ZIP code. For median-income, the estimated median-income is used as is, without further adjustments. ACS data are then pivoted wider, moving the different categories and percentages (ex: racial groups) to their own columns to create a single row for each ZIP code. This is necessary for joining the ACS data sets to the RIDS data set. 8.3.1.3 Data Joining 8.3.2 Statistical Analysis and Data Wrangling for Plots Each type of plot and map require unique data wrangling which is explained in this section. 8.3.2.1 Data Summary 8.3.2.2 Data Relationships 8.3.2.3 Spatial analysis 8.3.3 Data Limitations 8.3.4 Data updates 8.3.5 Server Hosting 8.3.6 Shiny Code Directory 8.4 How to Expand the Outdoor Equity App 8.4.1 Temporal Expansions 8.4.2 Spatial Expansions 8.4.3 Statistical Analysis References "],["additional-challenges.html", "Section 9 Additional Challenges", " Section 9 Additional Challenges "],["archive-access.html", "Section 10 Archive Access", " Section 10 Archive Access "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
