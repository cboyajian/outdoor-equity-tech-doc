## Purpose of the Outdoor Equity App

The [Outdoor Equity App](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/oe_app/) provides users with tools to explore trends at different overnight reservable sites to analyze access to these sites. The intended audience is federal public land managers and researchers as well as nonprofit organizations and recreation users. 

The [Recreation Information Database (RIDB) data](https://ridb.recreation.gov/landing) are comprehensive when it comes to information regarding the site and reservation, but do not include information about the visitor outside of their home ZIP code. [US Census American Community Survey (ACS) data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) is used to approximate socioeconomic demographics by joining information about the visitorsâ€™ home ZIP code to the RIDB data.
